# MCLN Nr3D experiment tracker

Updated: 2026-09-05 17:35 CST. Detailed evidence: master §§20.37–20.42.

| Experiment | Current state | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| G0 augmentation pair | Complete; integrity PASS, scientific FAIL | Keep data fix; original G0→G1 performance route sealed |
| P1 four-row padding identity and candidate audit | Complete | Selected seeds/Masks stable in four padding interventions; full object-memory availability remains incomplete. PR #7 stays draft |
| Independent P2 v1 | Complete; both heads 6,687 updates; terminal verification PASS | Pair-global REC -1/-84, pair-protected -3/+118 and lower Mask mIoU. Both fixed screens FAIL; do not advance this variant to P3 |
| P1 official-path diagnostic | Complete; native row/CSV/source/weight checks PASS | Current-source REC4478/3763 differs slightly from history4475/3759; no promotion. Full256 misses426; legal candidates exist for2995 current errors. Mask/CSV/SP analyses complete |

P2's 6,172-row, 98-scene holdout is from train scenes already seen by the frozen
backbone. Protected/global/pair REC hits are 6005/5312, 6003/5514, 6002/5430;
Mask mIoU 68.8766%, 68.6682%, 68.7242%. Do not label these official or unseen-system
results. Full256 lacks a qualifying box on only 25 rows, so this audit does not
represent the official validation failure distribution.

Raw P2 results and independent checks are in PR #8:
`refine-logs/p2_readout_v1_20260905/`. On the server, both final addon heads are
archived at `/root/autodl-tmp/mcln_g0_view_pair_20260905/pair_readout_train_v1/results/`.
P2 and the separate P1 native evaluation have ended; GPU now runs R1. No protected model
was replaced, no P2 formal validation ran, and the three-benchmark objective
is still incomplete. Nr3D protected REC remains 4475/3759 on 7899 rows.

Historical G0 boundaries: raw augmentation-permission changes 2155;
normalized text 325 (fit253/holdout72). These are permission counts, not all
numerical inputs changed by the continuous worker RNG. G0's auxiliary logging
defect did not affect its independently checked per-row decision.

Completed P1 report: `docs/NR3D_OFFICIAL_CANDIDATE_AUDIT_RESULT_2026-09-05.md`.
Existing Decoder object-memory input audit completed on four fit rows: 190 object slots, 38 covered by Queries, 155 correct predicted classes; not GT text-anchor recall. R1 four-arm reference-memory/readout control started at 17:35 after all CPU and real-fit zero-update checks passed. Fixed primary object_pair; all three advancement screens required. Draft PR #9 holds the pinned plan, implementation and receipts. No R1 result yet; P2 v1 remains sealed. The P1 raw-token field label correction is authoritative in `enrichment.json`.
